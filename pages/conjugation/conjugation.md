# `pages/conjugation/` ‚Äì Conjugation Games

## Overview

This directory is reserved for implementing verb conjugation games focused on the Russian language. It is part of the broader `/pages/` section, where interactive learning modules are organised by linguistic skill (e.g., typing, vocabulary, conjugation, etc.).

## Current Files

### `index.js`

```js
// ./pages/conjugation/index.js
// Empty file for conjugation page
```

* This file currently exists as a placeholder.
* Its presence ensures routing compatibility and prepares the ground for future implementation of conjugation games.

## Planned Features (To Be Developed)

The conjugation module will support:

* **Verb identification and matching** (e.g., player selects the correct conjugation for a given pronoun and tense).
* **Drills by tense**:

  * Present (–Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–µ–µ)
  * Past (–ø—Ä–æ—à–µ–¥—à–µ–µ)
  * Future (–±—É–¥—É—â–µ–µ)
* **Aspect practice** (imperfective vs perfective verbs).
* **Pronoun-based conjugation challenges** (e.g., "I", "you", "they", etc.).
* **Timed quizzes** to test speed and accuracy.
* **Input-based practice** with real-time feedback.

## Integration Roadmap

* [ ] Build a basic UI similar to `pages/typing/`.
* [ ] Load verb data from `data/verbs.js` (to be created).
* [ ] Create logic to display verbs and evaluate player responses.
* [ ] Add difficulty levels or categories (e.g. regular verbs, reflexives, irregulars).
* [ ] Provide hints or explanations after mistakes.
