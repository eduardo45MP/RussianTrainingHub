# `pages/declension/` â€“ Declension Games

## Overview

This directory is reserved for the implementation of declension-based mini-games and learning modules focused on Russian grammar. Declensions are a core part of the Russian language and mastering them is essential for accurate comprehension and communication.

## Current Files

### `index.js`

```js
// ./pages/declension/index.js
// Empty file for declension page
```

* This is currently a placeholder file.
* It ensures routing compatibility and scaffolds future features related to noun, adjective, and pronoun declension in Russian.

## Planned Features (To Be Developed)

Declension games will aim to reinforce understanding of:

* **The six Russian grammatical cases**:

  1. Nominative (Ð¸Ð¼ÐµÐ½Ð¸Ñ‚ÐµÐ»ÑŒÐ½Ñ‹Ð¹)
  2. Genitive (Ñ€Ð¾Ð´Ð¸Ñ‚ÐµÐ»ÑŒÐ½Ñ‹Ð¹)
  3. Dative (Ð´Ð°Ñ‚ÐµÐ»ÑŒÐ½Ñ‹Ð¹)
  4. Accusative (Ð²Ð¸Ð½Ð¸Ñ‚ÐµÐ»ÑŒÐ½Ñ‹Ð¹)
  5. Instrumental (Ñ‚Ð²Ð¾Ñ€Ð¸Ñ‚ÐµÐ»ÑŒÐ½Ñ‹Ð¹)
  6. Prepositional (Ð¿Ñ€ÐµÐ´Ð»Ð¾Ð¶Ð½Ñ‹Ð¹)

* **Declension of**:

  * Nouns
  * Adjectives
  * Pronouns
  * Numerals (eventually)

* **Game Types**:

  * Case matching: Choose the correct case for a given sentence.
  * Form completion: Fill in the blank with the correct declined form.
  * Multiple choice drills: Select correct forms based on context.
  * Drag-and-drop: Visually sort words by case or role in a sentence.

* **Difficulty Tiers**:

  * Beginner: Focus on nominative and accusative for singular nouns.
  * Intermediate: Introduction of plural forms and other cases.
  * Advanced: Irregulars, exceptions, and real-world application.

## Suggested Future Structure

* `logic.js`: Game logic and case selection rules.
* `cases.js`: Dataset defining case rules, endings, and exceptions.
* `examples.js`: Real usage examples for practice.
* `components/`: UI elements (e.g. form builders, feedback indicators).
